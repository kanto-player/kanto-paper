Finishing off a class like 4840 is always complicated. Each group needs to do two things: 
  
  * Wednesday and Thursday, May 15th and 16th: Presentations and Demos 
	
	Presentations and demos will be held in the lab, Mudd 1235. 
	One member from each group must sign up for a time slot at 
	http://doodle.com/ctnna6buya3i5swx.
	Each group will first give a formal presentation on their project. 
	Every member of each group must give part of the presentation. 
	I suggest dividing your presentation as follows: 
	
	 1. an overview of the project and its objectives, 
	 2. a discussion of the architectural and timing design, 
	 3. experiences and issues in implementation (the difficult parts), 
	 4. a summary including lessons learned. 
	
	This is a ten-minute presentation, so each member doesn't need to say much. 
	Powerpoint or PDF slides are encouraged but not required. Bring them on a 
	laptop since I won't have a computer for you. Each time slot is actually 
	30 minutes. After the formal 10-minute presentation, I will talk with each 
	group and actually learn whether every group member pulled his or her own 
	weight, whether your project actually works, how much of it actually works, 
	etc. You will show off your project during this time; have it set up before 
	you start the presentation. 

  * Thursday, May 16th: Final reports are due at 11:59 PM. 
	
	No extensions; I must submit grades on the 17th. Upload three things to Courseworks: 

	 1. a single PDF file of your whole report, including a listing of all 
		source code. Do remember to include all the sections listed on the 
		webpage. Do not turn in a paper copy of your report; it will be too big. 
		Only include source files (C, VHDL) you wrote or modified. Do not 
		include any automatically-generated files in your report. 
	 2. A .tar.gz file of your entire project. This should be in a form where I 
	    could compile and/or download your project as needed and therefore will 
		include some automatically-generated files, including the all-important 
		.sof file that can be downloaded to the board. However, before you make 
		this (potentially enormous) tarball, run the following to remove 
		unnecessary generated files: rm -rf db incremental_db *.rpt *.done 
		*.summary *.smsg *.pin *.qdf *.pof 
	 3. A PDF of your presentation. I'll put them on the class website. Name 
	    these based on your project's short name (from the website). 
		E.g., the "RSR" group shoud submit RSR.pdf, RSR.tar.gz, and RSR-presentation.pdf 

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
If one or more members of your group can't make any of the times listed, 
please let me know and we'll arrange something else.
